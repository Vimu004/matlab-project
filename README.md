## Overview

This project leverages MATLAB's powerful capabilities for analyzing user acceleration data. The analysis focuses on:
- **Inter-variance analysis**: Studying the variance between different users.
- **Intra-variance analysis**: Understanding variance within a single user dataset.

## Key Features

- **Variance Analysis**:
  - Visualizations for inter- and intra-user variance.
  - Detailed results for variance analysis stored in organized folders.

- **Model Development**:
  - Scripts and live scripts for building and testing models.
  - Outputs and prepared data files for reproducibility.

- **Data Understanding**:
  - Comprehensive exploration of user acceleration data.
  - Feature correlation analysis using MATLAB scripts.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vimu004/matlab-project.git
2. Open the MATLAB environment and navigate to the desired folder.

3. Run the MATLAB scripts (.m) or Live Scripts (.mlx) as needed.
